# Subtitle Workshop Pascal Scripts

Scripts that can be added to [Subtitle Workshop](http://subworkshop.sourceforge.net/) and run from it.

## Add_dubbing_symbols.pas

Add the respective line endings (i.e. "...;", "V", "VV") if the pause between two subtitles in milliseconds falls in between the described values (i.e. 500-999, 1000-3799, 3800+).
This is useful for the dubbers of a movie who would use the subtitle text to know if they can take a short break speaking.

## Strip_tags.pas

Remove all <u>, <i> and <b> tags from subtitles.
